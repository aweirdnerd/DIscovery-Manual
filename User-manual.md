 LSHTM Profiles and Discovery Module

# Guidance

## Overview

The School's Web profiles system will shortly be be changing to a new system for editing and supplying data, and a new expanded profiles portal, the Elements Discovery module


### Gateway v Discovery

The existing Gateway system for editing profiles will be retired, and all parts of the profile will be drawn from Elements, the School's Current Research Information System.


### Legacy profiles

#### Continuity

The existing People profiles will be retained as far as possible, to preserve the integrity of the School Website as a whole. They will continue to be updated, but now from data in Elements.


#### Link to More Publications

Currently the 'More Publications' link leads to a partial list of Publications, those that have been deposited as full-text in Research Online. In future this link will lead to a new expanded Profiles portal, the Elements Discovery Module, https://profiles.lshtm.ac.uk/


### Discovery Profiles

#### Broader profile

As well as a full publications list, the Discovery portal will showcase Grants, Professional Activities, and eventually, Teaching Activities


#### Instant updates

Discovery profiles synchronize with Elements in real-time, so edits you make in Elements will appear in Discovery in 2-3 minutes.


## Coverage

All profiles will depend on having a active account on Elements. Accounts become inactive immediately when employment or registration finishes


### Academic

#### Current Staff

Currently employed staff will have a Profile set to Public by default. Subsequent new staff profiles will be set to Internal only, to allow staff time to edit their details and add Publications, Grants and Activites.


#### Emeritus

Staff who are still active but no longer hold a contract of employment: accounts can be re-activated on request


#### Distance Learning Tutors

DL Tutors are not currently added automatically to Elements, but this is under review


### Research Students

### Professional Support

All PSP staff have Elements accounts


### MRC Units

We hope to have all Academic staff from the Units set up in ELements shortly


### Honorary

Honorary and Visiting staff accounts can be set-up on request. Former staff can be re-enabled as Honorary


## Privacy

Elements has a Profile privacy setting that will determine whether the user's profile will be displayed in Discovery, and the existing web profiles.


### Current users public

All current Elements users will be set to Public by default. [This may be reviewed for PSP staff]


#### Eprints warning

It is necessary to make all current users Public because this setting also affects the flow of data to Research Online. If you set an existing researcher to Internal, their authorship links will  disappear from all Journal Articles in Eprints, and their Author page will shrink or disappear entirely


### New users

Once the system is launched, new user accounts will be set to Internal by default, so that they can edit their profiles before making them Public. Or not.


### Object Privacy

Individual entries and objects can be set to Internal if you wish them to appear in your CV template but not on your public profile


## Profile

Much of this will be familiar from the CV Template:



- Employment- LSHTM appointments
- Other Academic Appointments
- Non-academic appointments

- Degrees
- Postgraduate Training
- Certifications
- Addresses
- Phone numbers
- Email addresses
- Language Competencies


### Bio

A general overview of your background and interests. There are also specific text fields for Research Interests and Teaching Summary, which appear on the Grants and Teaching tabs.  Note that this is a plain text field, and cannot include hyperlinks (unlike the current profiles). Links to other websites can be added as Web addresses or Media, see below


### Web addresses

These appear in a sidebar


### Media

Videos, but Youtube only, unfortunately


## Photo

## Publications

### Favourites

You can choose to mark some publications with a heart, as Selected/Favourites. These will be displayed as your selected publications in the website profiles. In the Discovery profile, Favourites will appear first, but you can switch to Most Recent First


### Privacy

You can hide Publications from your profile by marking your relationship as Internal


#### Internal

This will also remove them from your Author page on Research Online, though they will still be listed under year or other authors. Your name will not be highlighted in the author list


#### Private

This will also remove it from your CV template


### Sub-types

The listing will not distinguish between Journal Articles and Editorial/Commentary - that distinction is unique to the CV template


## Grants

### Research Interests

A free-text summary of your research interests appears on the Grants page


### Grants from Agresso

Research and Consultancy grants held by the School are imported into Elements once they are activated. Awarded grants still under contract negotiation will not appear. Nominal Grants are not imported


### Linking to Grants

The Principal Investigator is normally linked automatically based on the name held in Agresso. Sometimes this is out of date; fellowships may show the sponsor, not the recipient.


#### Adding Co-investigators

You should generally only add yourself as Co-I or Co-PI if you are known to the funder in that capacity


#### How to Link to Grant

### Modifying Grants

If you are linked to a Grant you are able to edit it, by adding a manual record


#### Add Manual Record

Only these fields are displayed in Discovery


##### Title

Titles as set in Agresso may not be very informative


##### Description

This free-text field allows you to include more information about the project, such as abstract, value, collaborators, Ultimate Funder, etc.


##### Funder

The Funder field in Agresso contains either the Ultimate Funder, or the Lead Institution in cases where LSHTM is a sub-contractor


##### URL

Link to funders award page, or project website


##### Start Date

##### End Date

### Adding grants

There are other Grant types that you can add to cover those not fed from Agresso


#### External

Current or historic grants held at other institutions


#### MRC

Grants held by the MRC Units


#### Other LSHTM

Internal grants and fellowships, Public Engagement grants,  disbursements from institutional block grants.


## Professional Activities

### Confidentiality

be sure not to put anybody's personal data when listing activities such as reviewing grants, or mock interviews


### External

#### Distinctions

#### Learned Societies

#### Funders roles

#### Journal Roles

#### Committees

#### Other[???]

### Internal

These local activities will not be published to your profile by default. You may choose to make individual items public


#### LSHTM Leadership

#### LSHTM Citizenship

## Teaching Activities

### Teaching Summary

Free-text field to describe your involvement in Teaching and Learning


### Research Degree Supervision [Under Construction]

Either added manually, or drawn from SITS Registry database [??]


### Teaching Feed (under construction)

We plan to draw data from the new Teaching Load and Allocation database, once it is running


## Labels

Users should edit their labels in Elements under the existing five label schemes.

- Research Areas

- Disciplines

- Diseases and Conditions

- Countries

- Regions





These will be automatically combined by Discovery into two broader label schemes for searching and filtering profiles in the new portal:

- Topics & Disciplines

- Regions & Countries



Users are encouraged to focus on their main specialisms rather than signalling their breadth of interests by ticking dozens of labels.


### Vocabulary updates

The controlled vocabularies for these labels are under review, but revisions will not be available in time for the launch of the new profiles. Further announcements will follow.


## Research Centres

There will be a  menu in Discovery showing the School Research Centres. Users may link themselves to Centres via Elements - Menu -My Profile - Projects - <paper-clip icon> Add Project Relationship
